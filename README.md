# KLOP Sardaukar (Personal Logic Operations Calculator)

## A Command-Line Tool for Interacting with AI Models

KLOP Sardaukar is a personal logic operations calculator built to work with AI models through a command-line interface. This tool allows users to generate code, execute tasks, and perform logical operations using an AI model. Itâ€™s perfect for those who need a simple yet powerful tool to run AI-powered operations from their console.

## How to use:
1. Install the requirements with the command:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   
2. Set the environment variable for API access:
   - For OpenAI, use: `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key`
   - Or for OpenRouter, use: `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key`

3. Run the program:  
   `python sardaukar.py`

4. **Optional: Working with LM Studio**  
   You can also use **LM Studio** as a local server by setting it up at `http://127.0.0.1:1234`. The application can work in **client mode** to connect directly to a locally running instance of LM Studio, providing an even more powerful and customizable AI experience.

## Key Features:
- **Smart Error Handling**: If there is an issue connecting to the AI model, the program will display an error message and return to the console, waiting for a new command. This avoids continuous retries and allows users to move forward quickly.
- **Version Control**: The tool automatically increments and updates its version, with each part of the version being color-coded for better readability.
- **Dynamic Error Correction in Code Execution**:
  - Automatically detects errors in generated code and sends it for correction to the local AI model.
  - Installs missing dependencies as needed and retries code execution after applying fixes.
  - Provides up to 3 attempts to correct and re-execute the code, ensuring stability and efficiency.
- **AI Interaction**: KLOP interacts with local AI models via API calls, which allows it to generate code based on user inputs, such as performing logical operations or calculations.
- **LM Studio Client Mode**: For those with LM Studio installed, the tool can connect to the local instance of LM Studio, allowing for even faster and more flexible AI processing, without relying on external API services.

### ðŸŒŸ **Examples of Use**:
- **General Tasks**:
  - Calculate the Fibonacci sequence and save it as a text file.
  - Create directories and organize files in the current directory based on their type.
  - Fetch weather data for a specific city and display it in a formatted table.
  - Generate a Python script to calculate complex mathematical equations and execute them.

- **Complexity Tests**:
  - Ask the AI to generate code to calculate mathematical derivatives using libraries like SymPy.
  - Request the AI to create a presentation about a scientific topic, such as the Eddington Luminosity.
  - Analyze financial data (e.g., $VIX and $SPY), merge them, and plot the results using libraries like Matplotlib.

### ðŸ§  **Code Overview**:
The `KLOP Sardaukar` is designed to interact with a large language model (LLM) and perform various tasks based on user input. The main components of the system are:

- **prompts.py**: Contains predefined prompts, calibration messages, and instructions for the LLM.
- **sardaukar.py**: The main script that handles user input, interacts with the local AI model (either OpenAI, OpenRouter, or LM Studio), and executes the generated code.

---

**Important Notes**:
- The program will not retry endlessly if the AI model is unavailable. If no connection is established, the system will notify the user and return to the command prompt, allowing them to try again.
- Each run automatically increments the version of the program, ensuring the latest improvements and features are in use.
- **Security Warning**: Always use this tool in a controlled environment, as executing arbitrary code could potentially cause issues on your system.
